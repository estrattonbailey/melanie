Because about pages are awkward and my age incites the classic, “you haven’t figured yourself out yet,” I vow to keep this short and sweet. I’m an Iowan raised on BLTs and farm chores who moved to Brooklyn because the coffee costs more. I design, I write, and I indulge in too many showtunes. No, I still haven’t seen Hamilton.

I <a href="https://twitter.com/agoddamnlady" target="_blank">tweet sometimes</a>, but, I recently got a cat, so… Well, you’ve been warned.

John Stamos (swoon) plays quite the grandpa in the FOX series, Grandfathered. To drive tune-in to this GILF, a pop-up barbershop was produced at The Grove in Los Angeles. With a custom design that felt fresh and modern and far-from-aged, we encouraged everyone to hop in to receive their own Grandfathered look.

Imagine climbing the iconic Aggro Crag from the 90’s Nickelodeon show, GUTS. (Yep, close your eyes and picture it.) Mountain Dew snagged the idea to raise awareness and cast votes for their DEWcision 2016 campaign, and the DEWggro Crag Powered by The Splat was born. Of course, such a marvel couldn’t merely live on its own, and an entire festival surrounded the setup, complete with dueling performers, soda sampling, giveaways, and more.

While the initial going was slow and steady, we have built the beast into an efficient machine and continue to make progress toward the initial goals.

Allow me to set the scene: You’re a young professional climbing the corporate ladder. You’ve been working long hours in a steel labyrinth somewhere, and you’re finally clocking out and heading home. Drowsily navigating your way to the exit, you took a wrong turn. You’ve come to a long hallway, covered by a bizarre smattering of platforms.

The beverage label: a classic project doled out to most design students. When tasked with this in my college days, I opted for a far-too-appealing craft beer brand. While the design may hit the target aesthetic, the ingredient list is vague and hopefully disconcerting. To carry the theme to it’s full potential, I completed the ensemble with a wooden crate full of straw. I mean, where else would you literally find Horse Piss?
