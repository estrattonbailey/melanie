Because about pages are awkward and my age incites the classic, “you haven’t figured yourself out yet,” I vow to keep this short and sweet. I’m an Iowan raised on BLTs and farm chores who moved to Brooklyn because the coffee costs more. I design, I write, and I indulge in too many showtunes. No, I still haven’t seen Hamilton.

I [tweet sometimes](https://twitter.com/agoddamnlady), but, I recently got a cat, so… Well, you’ve been warned.

I’m currently working in experiential marketing with [The Michael Alan Group](http://michael-alan.com/). Should you fancy a more formal resume, [email me](http://agoddamnlady.com/contact) (because I didn't finish it before launching this site).

Can you imagine climbing the iconic Aggro Crag from the 90’s Nickelodeon show, GUTS? Mountain Dew snagged the idea to raise awareness and cast votes for their DEWcision 2016 campaign, and the DEWggro Crag Powered by The Splat was born. Of course, such a marvel couldn’t merely live on its own, and an entire festival surrounded the setup, complete with dueling performers, soda sampling, giveaways, and more.

Layout, stage design, branding, and decor were major pieces I helped tackle for this project.

Allow me to set the scene: You’re a young professional climbing the corporate ladder. You’ve been working long hours in a steel labyrinth somewhere, and you’re finally clocking out and heading home. Drowsily navigating your way to the exit, you took a wrong turn. You’ve come to a long hallway, covered by a bizarre smattering of platforms. The fluorescent buzz fills your head as you catch the caution sign. “ATTENTION: FLOOR IS LAVA.”

Good luck, my friend.

Sure, the assignment was simply to build a site using parallax, but within it I discovered a grand opportunity.

I assure you I am most qualified, for I have never burped or tooted or looked a gentleman in the eye, and I always take my tea with a shot of brandy.

Jokey jokes. It’s all fun and games. See the whole thing here.

The beverage label: a classic project doled out to most design students. When tasked with this in my college days, I opted for a far-too-appealing craft beer brand. While the design may hit the target aesthetic, the ingredient list is vague and hopefully disconcerting. To carry the theme to it’s full potential, I completed the ensemble with a wooden crate full of straw. I mean, where else would you literally find Horse Piss?
