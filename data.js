To maintain my underwhelming mystique, I'm keeping this bio short and sweet. I’m an Iowan raised on BLTs and farm chores who moved to Brooklyn because the coffee costs more. A few months ago, I abandoned overpriced caffeine to move to Chicago, where, unsurprisingly, coffee is still moderately expensive.

I’m currently a freelance art director and graphic designer. Should you fancy a more formal résumé, <a href="/images/melanie-slattery-resume.pdf" target="_blank" class="no-ajax">your wish is my command</a>.

To promote the highly anticipated Audible Original, "Stan Lee’s Alliances: A Trick of Light" (performed by Yara Shahidi), we invited Comic-Con attendees to navigate an immersive audio labyrinth. Beginning within a bewildering storm of light and sound, guests traveled deeper into a cyber-inspired maze littered with secret codes, hidden audio triggers, and captivating light shows. To build buzz outside our venue, we deployed a troop of other-worldly OPTIC agents who playfully interrogated attendees throughout San Diego.

Almay stopped in 11 major cities while touring The American Look on their custom RV, offering free mini makeovers to attendees at State Fairs and Festivals across the country. Beyond the beauty, consumers were also invited to win Almay products and swag, or saunter over to a kissing booth to smooch their sweetheart. The activation included a partnership with the USO to raise money for our military and veterans.

Seeking to improve SEO performance and social influence, The Michael Alan Group set out to build a blog. I managed these efforts from the beginning; crafting a content strategy, working with freelance writers, composing my own pieces, researching topics, sourcing visual material, and building each article online. While the initial going was slow and steady, we have built the beast into an efficient machine and continue to make progress toward the initial goals.

The assignment was to build a website using parallax, but within it I discovered a grand opportunity. A chance to instruct women of the world on how to not merely be a lady, but be a goddamn lady. I assure you I am most qualified, for I have never burped or tooted or looked a gentleman in the eye, and I take my tea with a shot of brandy.
